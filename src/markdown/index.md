## About

One guy from the Connecticut shoreline! I bring my own tools and my own transport.

I'm based out of central Madison; I'll go as far west as West Haven, north as Middletown, and east as Old Saybrook. Not sure if you're in my area? Check the map!

(To cover gas, jobs more than 12 miles away are $8 extra.)
