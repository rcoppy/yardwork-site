## Hello!

I'm a semipro **software engineer** and **game developer**. 

Interested in working together? [Drop me a line!](alex@dossamer.io)

You'll probably want to see my [github](https://github.com/rcoppy), and my [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexruppcoppi/).

At the moment I'm in NYC wrapping up a BSc in **Computer Engineering** at Columbia University.

On the side, I head the tiny interactive media company Dossamer, a registered Nintendo developer. Dossamer's been an on-and-off project since 2017, but I've actually been coding (games and other stuff) since 2007. My first language was Python, and now I mostly work in C#. I cut my OOP teeth on Java in the early 2010s. Lately I've been discovering the joys of working in the open-source engine **Godot**, but I've got a lot of experience with **Unity**, too.

I also dabble in voice over narration and audio production, and every once in a while crank out some visual media.

I based this website on a template I wrote from scratch for a friend. It's fully mobile-responsive and (mostly) SEO-optimized (and it supports **markdown**!); if you'd like to use it as a base for your own projects, feel free to [grab the source here]() üôÇ

## Past jobs

For 12 weeks from May to August 2020, I was a **frontend software engineering intern** with the language-learning company **Babbel**. I did lots of things (even a little bit of game programming!), but most significantly, I reduced the cumulative layout shift of the USA homepage to near-zero, and shrank image bundle sizes by close to 80% via format and asset optimization. 

For six months in the second half of 2018, I was a **contract Unity developer** helping the NYC studio **Orc Punk** program and ship *Into the Dark: Narakan*, a roguelike on iOS that took home *Mobile Game of the Year* at the Playcrafting Bit Awards.

(Technically not a job), but in the summer of 2019 I completed a 10-week, full-stack web development bootcamp. The final project used a ruby + postgres + javascript + bootstrap stack.

## Skillsets

*This is actually the third or fourth iteration of my portfolio site, and I'm still working on porting over resources from the last one--for now, you can find links to previous (albeit dated) projects [here].*


### webdev 
- HTML5/CSS3/JS
- webpack 4
- babel
- a *little* bit of rollup
- project management/scaffolding with npm (some yarn)
- templating engines (pug/handlebars)
- DNS config/SSL certs
- Heroku
- GitHub pages, a little GitHub actions
- JSON/YAML
- React/Preact
- A little Vue
- A little Angular (can't remember which version)
- Ruby/Rails
- PostgreSQL


### gamedev
- Unity (less and less, though; the engine under current leadership is taking a bit of a nosedive)
- GameMaker 1.4 (fell off the bandwagon when 2.0 came out; YoYogames took a hit when it got acquired)
- Godot 3.2 (my new favorite)
- A teeny bit of Unreal 
- Modeling/rigging/animating in Blender 2.8
- Texture and 2D visual graphics work (proficient with PhotoShop)


### systems programming
Took a crashcourse at Columbia in C; got me familiar with Makefiles, linkers, etc. 


### UNIX/Linux
Because how can you not! lol

Back when Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) was in its infancy, I got a compositor (for Ubuntu) running in WSL to talk to a Windows-native X client, which was super jank because I was running a graphical Linux VM but also it wasn't a VM? Translated system calls are mysterious üòú

There's a totally different Linux graphical experience called **Phosh** (it uses **Wayland** instead of X üòé) which is actively being developed as a **FOSS** alternative to Android (no blobs at all in the mainline), and getting that running on top of a Debian VM was pretty baller. 

I'm not at the level where I can actually contribute to any of those projects, but it's pretty cool just to explore what's out there. 

And just to cover all the bases, I'm perfectly comfortable with ssh, FTP, command-line git, vim, and setting up the latest Minecraft server build as a system process üòÅ


### AWS
- Working a little bit with Lambdas (spinning up localstack instances for testing API endpoints)
- Configuring/deploying/managing an Elastic Beanstalk Wordpress blog/podcast feed (S3 + EC2 + EFS + RDS)
- Maintaining a single-instance EC2 Minecraft server for the little cousins


### audio engineering
- Proficient in Ableton Live (as an engineer, not a producer--getting there still üôÉ)
- Working with audio interfaces, condenser mics, multi-PC setups
- Okay at Adobe Audition (it's like fancier Audacity)


### video editing
Premiere is crazy expensive but it's also crazy fun! 


### Twitch streaming??
We all have our hobbies hehe 


### CAD 
Did a brief stint with Fusion360 for some hardware prototyping. 


## And that's about it!

Enjoy the rest of your day üåû
