Dossamer's been an on-and-off project since 2017, but I've actually been coding (games and other stuff) since 2007. My first language was Python, and now I mostly work in C#. I cut my OOP teeth on Java in the early 2010s. Lately I've been discovering the joys of working in the open-source engine <strong>Godot</strong>, but I've got a lot of experience with <strong>Unity</strong>, too.</p><p>I also dabble in voice over narration and audio production, and every once in a while crank out some visual media.</p><p>I based this website on a template I wrote from scratch for a friend. It's fully mobile-responsive and (mostly) SEO-optimized (and it supports <strong>markdown</strong>!); if you'd like to use it as a base for your own projects, feel free to <a href="">grab the source here</a> üôÇ</p><h2>Past jobs</h2><p>For 12 weeks from May to August 2020, I was a <strong>frontend software engineering intern</strong> with the language-learning company <strong>Babbel</strong>. I did lots of things (even a little bit of game programming!), but most significantly, I reduced the cumulative layout shift of the USA homepage to near-zero, and shrank image bundle sizes by close to 80% via format and asset optimization.</p><p>For six months in the second half of 2018, I was a <strong>contract Unity developer</strong> helping the NYC studio <strong>Orc Punk</strong> program and ship <em>Into the Dark: Narakan</em>, a roguelike on iOS that took home <em>Mobile Game of the Year</em> at the Playcrafting Bit Awards.</p><p>(Technically not a job), but in the summer of 2019 I completed a 10-week, full-stack web development bootcamp. The final project used a ruby + postgres + javascript + bootstrap stack.</p><h2>Skillsets</h2><p><em>This is actually the third or fourth iteration of my portfolio site, and I'm still working on porting over resources from the last one--for now, you can find links to previous (albeit dated) projects [here].</em></p><h3>webdev</h3><ul><li>HTML5/CSS3/JS</li><li>webpack 4</li><li>babel</li><li>a <em>little</em> bit of rollup</li><li>project management/scaffolding with npm (some yarn)</li><li>templating engines (pug/handlebars)</li><li>DNS config/SSL certs</li><li>Heroku</li><li>GitHub pages, a little GitHub actions</li><li>JSON/YAML</li><li>React/Preact</li><li>A little Vue</li><li>A little Angular (can't remember which version)</li><li>Ruby/Rails</li><li>PostgreSQL</li></ul><h3>gamedev</h3><ul><li>Unity (less and less, though; the engine under current leadership is taking a bit of a nosedive)</li><li>GameMaker 1.4 (fell off the bandwagon when 2.0 came out; YoYogames took a hit when it got acquired)</li><li>Godot 3.2 (my new favorite)</li><li>A teeny bit of Unreal</li><li>Modeling/rigging/animating in Blender 2.8</li><li>Texture and 2D visual graphics work (proficient with PhotoShop)</li></ul><h3>systems programming</h3><p>Took a crashcourse at Columbia in C; got me familiar with Makefiles, linkers, etc.</p><h3>UNIX/Linux</h3><p>Because how can you not! lol Back when Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) was in its infancy, I got a compositor (for Ubuntu) running in WSL to talk to a Windows-native X client, which was super jank because I was running a graphical Linux VM but also it wasn't a VM? Translated system calls are mysterious üòú</p><p>There's a totally different Linux graphical experience called <strong>Phosh</strong> (it uses <strong>Wayland</strong> instead of X üòé) which is actively being developed as a <strong>FOSS</strong> alternative to Android (no blobs at all in the mainline), and getting that running on top of a Debian VM was pretty baller.</p><p>I'm not at the level where I can actually contribute to any of those projects, but it's pretty cool just to explore what's out there.</p><p>And just to cover all the bases, I'm perfectly comfortable with ssh, FTP, command-line git, vim, and setting up the latest Minecraft server build as a system process üòÅ</p><h3>AWS</h3><ul><li>Working a little bit with Lambdas (spinning up localstack instances for testing API endpoints)</li><li>Configuring/deploying/managing an Elastic Beanstalk Wordpress blog/podcast feed (S3 + EC2 + EFS + RDS)</li><li>Maintaining a single-instance EC2 Minecraft server for the little cousins</li></ul><h3>audio engineering</h3><ul><li>Proficient in Ableton Live (as an engineer, not a producer--getting there still üôÉ)</li><li>Working with audio interfaces, condenser mics, multi-PC setups</li><li>Okay at Adobe Audition (it's like fancier Audacity)</li></ul><h3>video editing</h3><p>Premiere is crazy expensive but it's also crazy fun!</p><h3>Twitch streaming??</h3><p>We all have our hobbies hehe</p><h3>CAD</h3><p>Did a brief stint with Fusion360 for some hardware prototyping.</p><h2>And that's about it!</h2><p>Enjoy the rest of your day üåû</p></div></div><footer><div class="container"><p>Backgrounds from Bryan Ochalla and subtlepatterns</p><p>Site built by <a href="dossamer.io">dossamer</a></p></div></footer></div></html><script src="main.js"></script>
